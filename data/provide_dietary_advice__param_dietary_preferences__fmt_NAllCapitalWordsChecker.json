    "Hi there, I’ve recently decided to switch to a vegan diet because I want to improve my overall health and help the environment. However, I have a couple of health issues I’m concerned about: I have type 2 diabetes and mild hypertension that I’d like to manage better through dietary changes. With these conditions in mind, could you please give me personalized dietary advice that fits a vegan lifestyle and also helps address my specific health conditions? And if possible, I’d love it if you could also include some recipe suggestions to make this transition easier.",
    "I’ve been following a gluten-free diet for years due to celiac disease, but I’m struggling to lose weight and also have high cholesterol. My doctor suggested I focus on eating healthier, and I’d like some tailored advice on how I can adjust my gluten-free diet to address my goals of weight loss and cholesterol management, keeping celiac in mind. Please include as many recipe suggestions as possible so I can try new meals that fit all these requirements and support my health journey.",
    "I am currently trying to transition to a Mediterranean diet since I’ve read it’s good for heart health. However, I have chronic kidney disease and osteoarthritis, which makes meal planning tricky as I need to balance protein, potassium, and sodium intake. Could you give me detailed dietary recommendations taking into account these preferences and health challenges? Also, I would really appreciate it if you could share some recipe suggestions that I can try at home to help manage these conditions.",
    "I have recently discovered that I am lactose intolerant, and I’ve also been diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). I’d like to adopt a low-FODMAP diet that’s free from all dairy products. At the same time, I want to make sure I’m getting enough nutrients and not missing out on important food groups. Can you provide guidance on a suitable diet for me that accommodates these preferences and health conditions, and please include some recipe ideas that cater to both lactose intolerance and IBS?",
    "After a recent visit to my doctor, I learned that I have both hypothyroidism and prediabetes. I’m interested in following a paleo diet to see if it might help with my symptoms and energy levels. Could you give me comprehensive dietary advice that aligns with a paleo approach while taking my hypothyroidism and prediabetes into account? And I would love for you to include some recipe suggestions in your response, since I’m new to paleo cooking and need some inspiration."
