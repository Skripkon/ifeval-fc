I'm looking to first remove all temporary files to free up space, and then just quickly verify with Notepad if the operation is successful. Please do whatever is needed in the Windows command line to accomplish this.",

Please first run 'ipconfig /all', then 'ping google.com', and after that 'tracert google.com' so I can see all the outputs in sequence. Ensure these commands are chained together as needed for Windows.",

Please execute the command to remove this program, which I believe requires using 'wmic product where \"name='MyOldApp'\" call uninstall' on my system. Run this command and let me know if the uninstallation starts or if there are any errors."
