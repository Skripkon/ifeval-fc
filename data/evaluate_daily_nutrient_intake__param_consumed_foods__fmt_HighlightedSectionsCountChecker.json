    "Here's what I ate today, can you evaluate how my daily nutrient intake compares to the recommended values? For breakfast, I had a bowl of oatmeal with almond milk, a banana, and a cup of black coffee. Lunch consisted of a turkey sandwich with whole grain bread, lettuce, tomato, and a side of carrot sticks. As a snack, I had Greek yogurt with strawberries. For dinner, I ate grilled salmon, brown rice, steamed broccoli, and a small green salad with olive oil dressing. I am a 32-year-old adult and would say my activity level is moderate as I go for a 45-minute walk most days.",
    "I’m trying to improve my diet and would appreciate it if you could analyze my nutrient intake for today. I’m a senior and lead a mostly sedentary lifestyle since I retired. For breakfast, I had two slices of whole wheat toast with butter and jam, a hard-boiled egg, and orange juice. Lunch was vegetable soup with crackers, and a small apple. For dinner, I had chicken stew with potatoes, peas, and carrots, with a slice of apple pie for dessert. Could you evaluate how this compares with recommended daily values for my age and activity level?",
    "Can you assess whether my daily food choices are giving me the right balance of nutrients? I'm a teen who is pretty active—I play basketball after school almost every day. Today I had scrambled eggs and whole wheat toast for breakfast; at school, I ate a ham and cheese sandwich, some potato chips, and a banana for lunch; after basketball practice, I had a granola bar; and for dinner, we had spaghetti with meat sauce, a side salad, and garlic bread. Please tell me how this stacks up nutritionally for someone my age and activity habit.",
    "I've been tracking my meals as I'm trying to ensure I'm meeting my nutritional needs. Today, as a lightly active adult, I had the following: breakfast was Greek yogurt with honey and mixed berries plus a cup of green tea. Lunch was grilled chicken breast, quinoa, and steamed spinach. I had almonds and an apple for a snack. Dinner was beef stir-fry with bell peppers, broccoli, served over brown rice. Can you evaluate whether my intake matches daily recommended nutrients for my age group and activity level?",
    "Could you review my food intake for today and tell me how well I’m meeting the recommended nutrient targets? I’m a child and my activity level is moderate since I play outside for about an hour after school. For breakfast, I had a bowl of cereal with milk and an orange. For lunch, I ate a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, carrot sticks, and a granola bar. My afternoon snack was a cheese stick. Dinner was baked chicken tenders, mashed potatoes, green beans, and a slice of watermelon for dessert. Please provide insight on my nutrition based on these details."
