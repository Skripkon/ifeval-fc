    "I’ve found myself falling into the same eating patterns, and I’d really love your help putting together a meal plan that would shake things up. I adore Mediterranean and Japanese dishes, and I particularly enjoy meals that feature rice, grilled vegetables, and seafood (but I do avoid beef and pork). I am vegetarian and I also avoid all forms of gluten and dairy, so I’d need the plan to be strictly vegetarian, gluten-free, and dairy-free. My main health goal is to safely lose weight while making sure I’m getting all my nutrients. Can you create a meal plan tailored to these preferences and restrictions?",
    "I’m looking for a detailed meal plan that fits my lifestyle and helps me achieve some important health ambitions. My favorite foods revolve around Italian and Middle Eastern cuisines, and I really enjoy dishes with lots of legumes, tomatoes, and olive oil. I follow a vegan, nut-free, and halal diet, so nothing with any animal products, nuts, or non-halal ingredients. My goal right now is to build muscle mass in a healthy, sustainable way. Could you provide a carefully composed meal plan that incorporates all of these requirements?",
    "Could you please help me by crafting a custom meal plan for the next week? I tend to gravitate towards Asian and Mexican flavors, and my eating habits involve having small, frequent meals rather than three large ones. Additionally, I have to strictly avoid all dairy products and nuts, so please make the meal plan dairy-free and nut-free. I am hoping to maintain my current weight while making sure my energy stays high for my athletic training. Please take all this into account and create a suitable plan for me.",
    "I'm struggling to stay on track with healthy eating, especially since my tastes are quite varied. My preferences are for fresh, seasonal produce, and I love experimenting with recipes from South American and Indian cuisines. I must stick to a strictly kosher and gluten-free diet for medical and religious reasons. My health goal is to lose a few kilograms and maintain stable blood sugar levels. Can you put together a personalized meal plan that reflects these preferences, restrictions, and goals?",
    "I want to overhaul my eating habits and I’m hoping for your guidance in building a personalized meal plan. I absolutely love dishes that are spicy and full of bold flavors, with lots of vegetables and plant-based proteins, and I enjoy trying out new recipes from Thai and Moroccan cuisines. My dietary restrictions are vegan (no animal products at all), as well as halal and nut-free, so please make sure everything is suitable for those needs. My number one goal is to maintain my current healthy weight and support overall wellness. Can you design a plan with all of this information?"
