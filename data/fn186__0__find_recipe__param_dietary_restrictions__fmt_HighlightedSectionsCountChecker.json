    "I have a family member coming over for brunch who follows a strict gluten free diet, and I want to make something special for them. Could you please suggest a breakfast recipe that is gluten free and can be prepared in under 30 minutes? I really want it to be delicious and appropriate for someone who avoids gluten, and I do not want the preparation to take too long as I have other things to get ready. Ideally, something that the whole family would enjoy.",
    "I'm planning to host a dinner party this weekend, and one of my guests is vegan. I need to impress them with a tasty vegan main course, but I also don't want to spend the whole day in the kitchen, so I'm hoping to find a recipe that takes 45 minutes or less from start to finish. Can you recommend a suitable vegan main course recipe that fits within this 45-minute time frame and will make my dinner party a success?",
    "I’m trying to incorporate more vegetarian meals into my diet, and I’m craving something sweet. I also don’t have a lot of time on my hands today. Could you help me find a vegetarian dessert recipe that can be made in 20 minutes or less? I’m open to any kind of dessert as long as it’s quick to prepare and strictly vegetarian.",
    "As someone who is lactose intolerant, I have to avoid all dairy products in my meals. I’d really like to cook a dairy free breakfast tomorrow morning, but I only have about 15 minutes before I need to leave for work. Could you find me a breakfast recipe that is completely dairy free and doesn’t take more than 15 minutes to prepare? I would appreciate something fast, easy, and satisfying.",
    "My friend and I are looking to cook something together, but she follows a pescatarian diet and is really short on time today because of her busy schedule. Can you provide us with a pescatarian main course recipe that can be prepared in 25 minutes or less? We want something quick yet flavorful that accommodates her dietary restrictions."
