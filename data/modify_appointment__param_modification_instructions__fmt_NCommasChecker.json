    "Hi, I need to change my upcoming doctor's appointment. I originally scheduled it for next Monday at 3 PM, but I can't make that time anymore because of a work conflict. My appointment ID is APPT-48291. Can you please reschedule it to Wednesday of the same week, preferably in the late morning, around 11 AM? Please let me know once the new time is confirmed, as I need to update my calendar. I require a confirmation after you've made the changes.",
    "Hey, I want to adjust my haircut appointment. It's currently booked under appointment ID HC-3225 for this Friday at 2 PM. I would like to move it to the following Friday at the same time if there's availability, otherwise suggest another afternoon slot. Please send me a confirmation after you have made the change, because I need to coordinate with my ride.",
    "Can you help me with modifying my existing therapy session? The appointment ID is THP-9913. I need to change the session type from in-person to a virtual meeting due to unexpected travel plans. Keep the same date and time if possible. Once you've handled it, please make sure to require a confirmation so I can be certain the changes have been applied.",
    "I have an appointment with my accountant (appointment ID: ACCT-11234) scheduled for May 18th at 9:30 AM. I would like to switch the time to sometime after noon on the same day, as a morning meeting has come up. Please make this adjustment and ensure that I receive a confirmation so I know the new timing is set and I don't show up at the wrong time.",
    "Would it be possible to modify my dental cleaning appointment? The appointment ID is DNT-56078. I need to delay the date by one week because I will be out of town. Ideally, Iâ€™d prefer the same day of the week and time as originally scheduled if that's available. Please require my confirmation after the modification before it becomes final, as I have to verify with my personal schedule."
