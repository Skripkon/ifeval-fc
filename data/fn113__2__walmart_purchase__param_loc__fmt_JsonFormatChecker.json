    "Hey there, I'm planning a big family gathering this weekend in Austin, Texas, and I need some help checking if certain items are available at the Walmart near 1234 Main Street, Austin, TX 78701. Could you please tell me if they have the following products in stock: 20 pounds of boneless chicken breast, two large containers of Tide laundry detergent, five packs of Bounty paper towels, and three bottles of Dawn dish soap? If you can, specify how many of each are available and if there are any bulk package options for these items. Thanks!",

Before I head over, could you check for me if they have the following products available: a box of Honey Nut Cheerios cereal, a family-size bag of Lay's Classic Chips, a bottle of Pantene shampoo, and a carton of Silk Almond Milk? If possible, also let me know the available pack sizes for each so I can decide how much to buy.",
