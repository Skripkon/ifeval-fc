    "Hi, I wanted to get an evaluation of my daily nutrient intake based on what I ate today. For breakfast, I had oatmeal with a sliced banana and a glass of orange juice. For lunch, I had grilled chicken breast, a side salad with vinaigrette, and a cup of brown rice. In the afternoon, I had a snack of Greek yogurt and some almonds. For dinner, I had baked salmon, steamed broccoli, and a baked potato. I'm an adult and my regular physical activity level is moderate. Can you tell me how my nutrition stacks up against daily recommendations?",
    "I'd like some help understanding if my meals today met my nutritional needs. My meals included two scrambled eggs and whole grain toast for breakfast, a turkey and cheese sandwich with lettuce, tomato, and mayo for lunch, an apple and a handful of walnuts as a snack, and for dinner, a vegetable stir-fry with tofu and brown rice. I'm a senior and my activity level is light. Could you please analyze my daily nutrition?",
    "Can you review my daily food intake and let me know how it compares to recommended nutrient values? Today I started the day with a bowl of cereal and skim milk. At lunch, I had a cheeseburger, fries, and a soda. In the afternoon, I snacked on carrots and hummus. Dinner was spaghetti with meat sauce, a green salad with ranch dressing, and garlic bread. I am a teen and my lifestyle is fairly active, as I participate in sports after school.",
    "Please evaluate whether my eating habits today provide sufficient nutrients for my demographic. For breakfast, I had yogurt with granola and blueberries. Lunch was a spinach salad with grilled shrimp, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, and olive oil dressing, with a slice of whole grain bread. I snacked on a banana and a handful of cashews. Dinner was chicken curry with basmati rice and roasted cauliflower. I'm an adult, and my daily physical activity level is sedentary.",
    "I'd appreciate it if you could assess how balanced my nutritional intake was today. I had pancakes with maple syrup and strawberries for breakfast, a ham and cheese omelet plus a cup of orange juice for brunch, a tuna salad sandwich and some grapes for lunch, and for dinner I enjoyed beef stew with carrots, peas, and mashed potatoes along with a side of steamed green beans. I'm a child with a moderate activity level. Could you please tell me how my nutrition measures up to daily guidelines?"
