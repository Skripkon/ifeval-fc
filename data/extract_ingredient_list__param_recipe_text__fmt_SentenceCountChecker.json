    "Hi, I found this recipe online that I want to try out, but it's embedded in a long article and hard to separate the ingredients. Could you please help me by going through the following recipe and listing all the ingredients, including the quantities, in a comma-separated values (csv) format? Here is the complete recipe text: 'To make the ultimate chocolate cake, preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans. In a large bowl, combine 2 cups all-purpose flour, 2 cups granulated sugar, 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 cup milk. Add 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 2 eggs, and 2 teaspoons vanilla extract. Beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. Finally, stir in 1 cup boiling water. Pour the batter evenly into prepared pans and bake for 30-35 minutes. Let cool before frosting.' Thank you!",
    "I have this pasta recipe my family loves, but I'd like to get a clean, easy-to-read list of the ingredients only, without the amounts, so I can customize it. Could you extract just the ingredient names from this text and present them in a regular list format (not csv)? Here is the recipe: 'Cook 12 ounces of spaghetti in salted water until al dente. While pasta cooks, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet, then add 3 minced garlic cloves and cook until fragrant. Add 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes and 1 pound peeled shrimp, cook until pink. Toss shrimp with drained pasta, add 1/4 cup chopped parsley, the juice of 1 lemon, and top with grated parmesan as desired. Serve immediately.'",
    "Could you please read this recipe and give me a detailed CSV list of every ingredient used, making sure to include the specific quantities each time? I want to make sure I get the shopping right. Here is the entire recipe: 'For the classic beef stew, start by cutting 2 pounds of beef chuck into cubes. Season with salt and pepper and brown in 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Remove beef and sauté 1 large chopped onion, 2 diced carrots, and 3 minced garlic cloves until soft. Return beef to pot, add 3 tablespoons tomato paste, 4 cups beef broth, 1 cup red wine, 3 sprigs of thyme, and 2 bay leaves. Simmer for 2 hours. Add 3 diced potatoes and cook until tender. Discard herbs and serve hot.' Thanks a lot!",
    "I'm putting together a shopping list and have this detailed recipe for homemade vegetable lasagna, but it's a bit complicated and I keep missing ingredients. Could you go through the recipe below and list all the ingredients (just the names, don't worry about the quantities this time), and put them in a csv format so I can paste it easily? Here is the recipe: 'Preheat oven to 375°F. In a large saucepan, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil and cook 1 diced onion, 2 cloves garlic, and 1 chopped bell pepper until soft. Add 3 cups spinach and cook until wilted. In a bowl, combine 15 ounces ricotta cheese, 1 egg, and 1/4 cup grated parmesan. Layer cooked lasagna noodles, ricotta mixture, sautéed vegetables, and 2 cups marinara sauce in a baking dish. Top with 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese. Bake for 45 minutes.'",
    "I have this old family recipe that I want to share with my friends, but it's written out in paragraph form and the ingredients are mixed in with the steps. Can you please help me extract every ingredient from the text, including the amounts specified, and give me the list in a simple bullet point format? Here is the recipe: 'To bake the banana bread, start by preheating oven to 350°F. Mash 3 ripe bananas in a large bowl, then mix in 1/3 cup melted butter. Stir in 1/2 cup sugar, 1 beaten egg, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Add 1 teaspoon baking soda, a pinch of salt, and 1 1/2 cups flour. Pour batter into a greased loaf pan and bake for 50-60 minutes.
