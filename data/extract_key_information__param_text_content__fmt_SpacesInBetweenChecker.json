Here is the article text: \"The European Union has pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030, according to a 2020 agreement by member states. Germany, France, and Spain have all increased solar investments since 2019, with Germany producing over 40 gigawatts of solar power in 2022. The International Energy Agency reported that Europe saw the fastest growth in wind energy installations worldwide last year. New policies encourage electric vehicle use and energy efficiency in homes. Investment by private firms has reached 50 billion Euros annually. Economists predict renewable energy jobs in the EU could reach 2 million by 2025.\" I would like you to extract the key factual information, and please include any references or sources mentioned.",

    "I need your assistance with summarizing a scientific paper for me. Here is the full text: \"The study conducted by Dr. Elena Torres and her colleagues at Stanford University in 2022 analyzed the migration patterns of monarch butterflies. The researchers tagged 2,500 butterflies, tracking their 3,000-mile journey from Canada to central Mexico. The research, funded by the National Science Foundation, found that 87% of tagged butterflies survived the migration, a significant increase from previous years. Collaborators included experts from Cornell University and the University of Toronto. The full paper was published in the journal Nature Ecology. Major findings suggest climate change has positively influenced migration success rates, and Dr. Torres was awarded the Environmental Scientist of the Year prize.\" Please extract all the names mentioned and don't forget to include the references or sources provided in the text.",
    "I've been reading this long and complex news story and want to distill it to just the key facts. Here's the news article: \"On June 10, 2023, a significant cybersecurity breach occurred at TechCore Solutions.
